# Learning Task 2

## Learning Objectives

* Unit testing in Python

## Issues

* Read about the Python `unittest` module 
  [here](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/unittest.html) and
  [here](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/tests/). Start thinking about
  how you would unit test the code that you wrote in Learning Task 1.
* In your `csdbg-client` folder, create a file called `test_csdbg.py`. Implement
  unit tests using the Python `unittest` module to achieve as much code
  coverage as you can for the code that you wrote in Learning Task 1.
* Rewrite any code that you wrote in Learning Task 1 that requires refactoring
  to make for easier test cases.
* Use the `unittest.mock` functionalities to mock out any dependencies of your
  functions.
